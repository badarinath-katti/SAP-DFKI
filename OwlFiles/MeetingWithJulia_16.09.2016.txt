Dont deal with ERP, 
Lot size 1
Automatic creation of BOM?
How BOM is converted to production order and shop order?
Variant BOM vs Multiple BOMS? BOM for lot size 1

Difference between operations and routing?

Single level BOM

*****Alternate routing instruction

repetitive manufacturing

MASter BOOM vs Production order BOM


"Release of the Production shop order in SAP ME triggers production on the shop floor"
"When the production order is updated in SAP ERP, the new data is transferred to SAP ME."

If the shop order has been already released in SAP ME and if the production has already 
started (SFC numbers are In Work), the following field values cannot be updated:
BOM
Routing

Does production order with routing information created at SAP ERP?
Material master data

How order placed via online portal reach SAP ME?

"Routing" is tied to SFC or material or BOM?

*****planned order Purchase order production order shop order??













Want to simulate the manufacture of variant products.
What are the basic and necessary i need to simulate to mock ME?
*****What are exceptional cases if I get all the information for a particular SFC at once?
*****What data is received by each work station for a particular sfc ?
How to define BOm for variant configuration?
How does routing information stored?
How to define work centres?
Difference between customer order (this has priority attribute), purchase order, shop order and sales order?
How to release a shop order? Does shop floor know automatically? Or does it need to poll??

How do we acknowledge completion of a particular step in manufacturing? i.e..  
How to hold on a SFC, material, routing and shop order...... release later

Before releasing the shop order do we need to look at Warehouse for availability of raw materials?

How customer order translates to Shop order and then SFC?

Assumptions:
Shop order can have multiple SFCs
SFC <==> Only 1 product.. one on one mapping??
Shop order = Lot size 1. Quantity of each sfc = 1. (Material maintenance)
We will not address machine setup
Customer maintenance => Customer Order Maintenance => Shop Order Maintenance => 
	Shop Order Release or Create and Release Demand.

FIELDS : Shop order, Bill of material, 
Transfer of production order with BOM and routing to from SAP ERP to create the corresponding BOM with defined assembly operations
to production shop order in SAP ME

we will ignore product costing

Information:
"Once you create a customer order record, you can then release it to the shop floor using either
 	Shop Order Maintenance and Shop Order Release or Create and Release Demand."

complex routing 
shortest distance, other carriers in that path
